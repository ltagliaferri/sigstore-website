    header: How can you use it?
    text: We’ve combined a few technologies that can be used independently, or as
      one single process. It’s a way for software developers to sign off on what
      they build, without needing to jump through hoops or know tricky security
      protocols. And it’s a way for anyone using those releases to verify the
      signatures against a tamper-proof log.
